# Swatches

Swatches is a utility for getting variations on a colour.

To use Swatches, type or paste a hexadecimal colour code into the text entry, with or without a hash mark. You'll then be given two columns of colours. The left column offers changes in luminence only, while the right column gives difference in brightness.

To copy any of the colours to your clipboard, simply click on the desired shade.
