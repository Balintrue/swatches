# Swatches

[(点击这里阅读中文版本)](https://github.com/keyilan/swatches/blob/master/README_zh.md)

Swatches is a colour palette utility for getting variations on a colour.

To use Swatches, type or paste a hexadecimal colour code into the text entry, with or without a hash mark. You'll then be given two columns of colours. The left column offers changes in luminence only, while the right column gives difference in brightness.
